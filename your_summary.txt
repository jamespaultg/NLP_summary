The Chrysler Building

The Chrysler Building, the famous art deco New York skyscraper, will be sold for a small fraction of its previous sales price. The incentive to sell the building at such a huge loss was due to the soaring rent the owners pay to Cooper Union, a New York college, for the land under the building. Meantime, rents in the building itself are not rising nearly that fast. The Chrysler Building was the headquarters of the American automaker until 1953, but it was named for and owned by Chrysler chief Walter Chrysler, not the company itself.
